# Test Usage Documentation

## Introduction

This document provides instructions on how to use the tests in the `tests/` directory. The tests are written using the Chai assertion library and can be run using a test runner like Mocha or Jest.

## Prerequisites

Before running the tests, ensure you have the following installed:
- Node.js
- npm (Node Package Manager)

## Installation

1. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```sh
   cd tabu-db-api
   ```

2. Install the project dependencies:
   ```sh
   npm install
   ```

## Running the Tests

To run the tests, use the following command:
```sh
npm test
```

## Test Files

The test files are located in the `tests/` directory and include the following:
- `example_test.js`: Contains example tests.
- `index_test.js`: Contains tests for the main index file.
- `models_test.js`: Contains tests for the data models.
- `dto_test.js`: Contains tests for the data transfer objects.
- `routes_test.js`: Contains tests for the API routes.

## Example Test

Here is an example of a test file using Chai:

```javascript
const { expect } = require('chai').expect;

describe('Example Test Suite', () => {
  it('should pass a simple test', () => {
    expect(1 + 1).to.equal(2);
  });

  it('should test a function', () => {
    function add(a, b) {
      return a + b;
    }
    expect(add(2, 3)).to.equal(5);
  });
});
```

## Conclusion

This documentation provides a basic overview of how to use the tests in the `tests/` directory. For more detailed information, refer to the official documentation of the testing frameworks and libraries used.
